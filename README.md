# Teaching Calendar

Simple Teaching Calendar with Django We aim to develop a straightforward teaching calendar application using the Django framework. This application will provide teachers with a personalized view of their teaching schedule, including the subjects they teach and the lesson names scheduled for specific dates.

## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy teaching_calendar

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
